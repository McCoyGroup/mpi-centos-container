# MPI-CentOS Container

A base container with only CentOS OMPI installed. Needs to use CentOS to run properly with MPI on Mox, so `Tensorflow-MPI` is only useful if you want to use 1 node or fewer for MPI jobs :(.

This is meant to be the base to McEnv, in which the `CentOS` branch of `McEnv` builds off of this. Under construction.
